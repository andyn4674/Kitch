## Ideas
- 2 types of users customers vs sellers 
- customers:
+ input their locations? how far they willing to drive?
+ show available food postings (near the users?)
+ be able to search for specific restaurant all dishes
+ maybe: can order? show if their order is ready for pick up
+ see the contact info of the restaurant
+ drop reviews
- sellers:
+ profile basics info
+ post new dishes
+ maybe: view orders, change the order status (ready to pick up, in progress)
